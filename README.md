# **Data Analysis at PT Zona Edukasi Nusantara (Zenius)**
Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Independent Study program titled Data Analysis at PT Zona Edukasi Nusantara (Zenius), held by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. Throughout this program, I completed several assignments and final projects. I will briefly describe each assignment and final project below:
<br>

## Assignments 
1. **[Python Structure & Data Type](https://github.com/nurlitaakho/Zenius-Stupen/tree/main/Topic%203%204%20-%20%5BNurlita%20Kholishotunnisa%5D)** - In this assignment, I coded about Data Types and Data Structures in Python, including: Numpy Arrays, Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, and Sets according to the instructions given. I received a score of 98/100 for this assignment.
2.  **[Data Cleansing](https://github.com/nurlitaakho/Zenius-Stupen/tree/main/Topic%205%20-%20%5BNurlita%20Kholishotunnisa%5D)** - In this assignment, I used the Telco Customer Churn data from Kaggle to perform data cleansing such as missing value checking, categorical data encoding, also anomalies and outlier checking. I received a score of 98/100 for this assignment.
3. **[Data Preparation](https://github.com/nurlitaakho/Zenius-Stupen/tree/main/Topic%206%20-%20%5BNurlita%20Kholishotunnisa%5D)** - In this assignment, I perform advanced data frame operations (join, append), data manipulation (aggregation, pivot table), and feature engineering (column join, inter-column operations). I received a score of 98/100 for this assignment.
4. **[Data Visualization](https://github.com/nurlitaakho/Zenius-Stupen/tree/main/Topic%207-8%20%5BNurlita%20Kholishotunnisa%5D)** - In this assignment, I used the Titanic data to create data visualization including boxplot, distplot, boxplot, scatterplot and pie chart. I received a score of 100/100 for this assignment.
5. **[Descriptive and Inferential Statistics](https://github.com/nurlitaakho/Zenius-Stupen/tree/main/Topic%209%2010%20-%20%5BNurlita%20Kholishotunnisa%5D)** - In this assignment, I used probability and statistical methods to study a data set of diabetes patients. I received a score of 99/100 for this assignment.
6. **[Exploratory Data Analysis with Python](https://github.com/nurlitaakho/Zenius-Stupen/tree/main/Topic%2011%2012%20-%20%5BNurlita%20Kholishotunnisa%5D)** - In this assigment, I used the Telco Customer Churn data from Kaggle to perform the Exploratory Data Analysis step which aims to understand the main characteristics of a dataset, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and gain insights that can guide further analysis or decision making. I received a score of 97/100 for this assignment.
7. **[Supervised and Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/nurlitaakho/Zenius-Stupen/tree/main/Topic%2013%2014%20-%20%5BNurlita%20Kholishotunnisa%5D)** - In this assignment, I used the House Prices data to build regression models to predict the selling prices of the house. I also used Mall Customer data to perform classification using K-Means Cluster algorithm. I received a score of 96/100 for this assignment.
8. **[SQL](https://github.com/nurlitaakho/Zenius-Stupen/tree/main/Topic%2015%2016%2017%20-%20%5BNurlita%20Kholishotunnisa%5D)** - In this assignment, I used the dvd rental data to answer some questions using Postgre-SQL and I also made a visualization of the answers to these questions using Python. I received a score of 100/100 for this assignment.
9. **[Covid-19 Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/9890e39d-0cd9-405a-9d5c-1dd84566ad27)** - In this assignment, I used Covid-19 Data to create an interactive dashboard using Looker Studio. This dashboard contains visualizations and data information that is expected to help stakeholders analyze and make decisions.
I received a score of 96/100 for this assignment.

# Final Project
**[Home Credit Analysis](https://github.com/nurlitaakho/Zenius-Stupen/tree/main/Final%20Project)** - In this final project, I used Home Credit data to build Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) models to predict loan default. I received a score of 90/100 for this project.

I hope you find this repository helpful and feel free to contact me with any questions or comments. Thank you for visiting!
